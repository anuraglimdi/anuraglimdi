### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Anurag Limdi, currently a PhD Candidate in Michael Baym's lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the Harvard Medical School. I am very broadly interested in exploring how biological systems function and evolve, through a combination of high-throughput experiments, theory and computational approaches. I am also interested in applying machine learning to large biological datasets to glean insights into antibiotic resistance, genotype to phenotype prediction and more.

In my thesis research, I investigate how fitness landscapes change over thousands of generations of bacterial evolution by generating transposon insertion libraries (with >100,000 mutations) in ancestral and evolved states, and analyzing statistical patterns of changes in fitness effects and gene essentiality (read our preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.17.492023v1)). In the process, I developed an approach for detecting and correcting PCR amplification bias in transposon sequencing by addition of unique molecular identifiers (github repo and paper forthcoming). 

You can find all my papers and preprints [here!](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wgm55b0AAAAJ&hl=en)
