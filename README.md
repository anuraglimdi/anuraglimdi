### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Anurag Limdi, currently a PhD Candidate in Michael Baym's lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the Harvard Medical School. I am very broadly interested in exploring how biological systems function and evolve, through a combination of high-throughput experiments, theory and computational approaches. In my research as an undergrad and PhD student, I have studied the ecology and evolution of microbes and microbial communities, and tested ideas from theoretical ecology and population genetics in experiments!

You can find my papers and preprints [here!](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wgm55b0AAAAJ&hl=en)
