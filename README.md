### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Anurag Limdi, a Data Scientist at Apriori Bio, where I integrate machine learning and analyses of deep mutational scanning experiments of proteins to understanding genotype to phenotype mapping and inform vaccine design for infectious diseases. 

**Research Interests**

These days, I think about problems that span molecular evolution, protein design, and applying machine learning to problems in biology. Trained as a systems biologist at the intersection of computational and lab science, I believe in deeply understanding quirks and biases in biological datasets, particularly large genomics datasets, in order to build generalizable models.

**My PhD Research**

I got my PhD at Harvard with Michael Baym, I explored how bacterial genomes function and evolve, through a combination of high-throughput experiments, theory and computational approaches. My projects include:

- Mapping fitness landscapes over thousands of generations of the long-term evolution experiment ([Paper](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.add1417), [Code](baymlab/2022_Limdi-TnSeq-LTEE)). Our paper got featured in [Nature Reviews Genetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-024-00707-z) and I chatted with [ScienceAdviser](https://www.science.org/content/article/scienceadviser-scent-female-mice-shortens-lives-males) about what we found and implications for the field of evolutionary biology.
- Fitness assay design using theory, Monte-Carlo simulations to explore tradeoffs in design parameters ([Paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00239-023-10110-7), [Code](https://github.com/baymlab/2022_Limdi_limits-pooled-fitness-assays)).
- Methods development for correcting for PCR-related artifacts in transposon sequencing experiments ([Code](https://github.com/anuraglimdi/umi_tnseq)).
- Modeling DNA-binding biases of the mariner transposon ([Code](https://github.com/anuraglimdi/transposon_binding_motif)).
